#### Basic Overview

> What will the application do? 
>
This application will contain many different simple & more complex games for a user to play.

> Who will use it?

My intended audience is children in elementary school, but anybody can play.

>   Why is this project of interest to you?

I always enjoyed the idea of making games, but I wanted to create something with more utility than the average game.
This project was inspired by many of the children I've seen playing on phones or tablets; I know technology can have a
huge impact on people, and I want to mitigate its impact on a developing brain.
